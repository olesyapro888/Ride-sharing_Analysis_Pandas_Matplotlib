## `Overview of the PyBer ride-sharing analysis`	
	
The purpose for the PyBer ride-sharing analysis were: 	
1. Create and analyse a summary of the ride-sharing key metrics by city type.
2. Create and observe a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 	
3. Summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.	
## `Resources`	
The analysis was created using next resources:	
  - Data Source:  [Resources](./Resources/)	
  - Software: Python 3.8.8, Matplotlib 3.3.4, Pandas 1.2.4, Anaconda 4.10.3, Jupyter-notebook, 6.3.0.	
## `PyBer ride-sharing Analysis Result`	
	
Full results can be found in the [PyBer ride-sharing Analysis](./PyBer_Challenge.ipynb) file.	
  ### ` - A ride-sharing summary by city type`	

  - The ride-sharing summary by city type shows: the Total Rides, Total Drivers, the Total Fares, the Average Fare per Ride, and the Average Fare per Driver.

  - Multiple-line graph of the total weekly fares for each city type shows: the trend of Total Fares in $USD from January to the end of April 2019.

  ### ` - The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types`	

Based on the ride-sharing summary by city type analysis, the differences display below results:

  - Total rides column shows that the Total Rides in Urban is 1,625, which is 2.6 times more than Surburban's rides, and 13 times more than Rural's rides.

  - Total drivers column demonstrates that the Total Driver in Urban is 2,405, which is 4.9 times more than Surburban's drivers, and 30.8 times more than Rural's drivers.

  - Total Fares illustrates that the Total Fares in Urban is $ 39,854, which is 2 times more than Surburban's fares, and 9.2 times more than Rural's fares. 

  - The Average Fare per Ride in Urban is $24.53, which is 0.8 times less than Suburban one, and 0.7 times less than Rural.

  - The Average Fare per Driver in Urban is $16.57, which is 0.4 times less than Suburban one, and 0.3 times less of Rural.

 Using images from multiple-line chart the result is following.
  - The chart of Total Fare by CityType shows that Suburban's fares show different trend from last week of March till the end of April comparing with Rural and Urban trends respectively. In more detail, when Rural and Urban fares grow Suburban's fare drops and it rockets from second week of April. So, it request additional analysis to understand why it happened.

## `PyBer ride-sharing Analysis Summary`	

The analysis provides a lot of summarizing but the 3 can be chosen as main and essential business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Firstly, the analyse says the Urbun's average fare is the lowest. So, it points at the drivers are more than total rides taken. Therefore, it demands to decrease the drivers in Urban area. 

Next, in the same time, the Rural's fare is the biggest. So, Rural area should decrease their fare per ride to be more attractive for clients and to hire drivers more. But also, it can be that drivers drive longer distance. If so, it needs to attract more drivers it needs to organise marketing campaigns and others activities. 

Finally, Urbun area shows great trend by increasing their weekly fare income from January to April except 1 month from last week in Februaly till last week in March. So, that is perspective market for the company.
Additionally, comparing with Rural and Urban trend Suburban area shows unusual trend from last week of March to the end of April. It definetly demands to have an additional analysis.
